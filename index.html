                    The UrbReas workshop is scheduled on September 14, 2018 and will be held at Dublin, Ireland.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    UrbReas will be co-located with European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (<a href="http://www.ecmlpkdd2018.org/">ECML/PKDD</a>).
                </p>

                <p align="justify">The theme of the workshop is "Urban Reasoning" which focuses on reasoning from complex challenges in cities. 
                    Urban reasoning is a process that empowers and extends the urban computing’s
                    vision as well as its applications. Urban computing aims to help us understand the 
                    nature of urban phenomena and predict the future of cities. Urban reasoning aims in 
                    extending this vision with a main focus on providing insights about the reasons of 
                    the major challenges that our cities face (e.g., crowd congestions,increased network 
                    demand, air pollution, water floods, etc.). Urban reasoning relies on  a  multi-stage  
                    analytics  process  employing  advanced  machine  learning  and data mining 
                    techniques to provide deeper insights and new type of applications to  various stakeholders  
                    where  the  initial  data  analytics  stage(s)  is applied on a city-wide scale for deriving 
                    context information while the followingstage(s) focuses  on  the  analytics  related  to  
                    a  certain  domain  challenge.  The context  
                    information  derived  from  the  first  stage(s)  analytics  is  further  fusedinto  
                    the  following  stage(s)  with  the  aim  of  providing  insights  and  reasoning 
                    behind  certain  domain  challenges  that  cities  face.  Urban  reasoning  relies  on 
                    other traditional fields like environmental engineering, civil engineering, network engineering, 
                    transportation, and sociology in the context of urban spaces.</p>
